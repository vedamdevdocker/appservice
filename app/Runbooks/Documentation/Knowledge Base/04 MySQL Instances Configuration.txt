This document will help how to setup Company_x directories , instances & connect to those instances

Company folder structure :
SAS Application directory : C:\SAS Opera\Companies
For example there are any Company sub directory exists like below they look like below
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1
	The below subfolder structure for Company_0 point of view ( assuming 4 instances 0 to 3)  
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application\AppService
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application\WebClient
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\instance
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\instance\cnf
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\schema
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\schema\scripts
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\schema\scripts\create
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\schema\scripts\delete
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances  ( Here I create 4 instances in this case )
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance0 
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance1
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance2
	C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance3
	
Database 
	The data file will be located in each instance. For example, for instance1, the path will be:
		C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance1\data
		After installation or data directory created successfully , you can find a file named DELPHI-K.err in the data directory. This file contains the root password, which can be identified in the following entry:
		2024-12-11T20:34:14.665632Z 6 [Note] [MY-010454] [Server] A temporary password is generated for root@localhost: :bfXda>*=9jk
		
		NOTE : Once the data directory is successfully created, run the 05_get_mysql_root_pwd.bat file. This will execute the Python script 05_get_mysql_root_pwd.py, 
		which generates a file named root_password.txt in each instance folder.	This file contains the root password for that specific instance. 
		You can change the root password later if required.
		
		connect mysql using command prompt and create a new user and password if needed
		
Update .instance.cnf file 
	Each instance has a data file used to store data. To connect the application to the database, the .instance.cnf 
	file needs to be updated. This file is located in the instance directory, 
	for example, for instance1, the path is:C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance1
	
	[client]
	user=vedamc0in1
	password=welcome
	host=localhost
	port=3312
	
Update my.ini file
		It is necessary to update my.ini file of every instance , this is manual process on the day this document is written
		for example in case of instance1 this file is located in the directory 
		C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance1
	
The above activates are partly automated , so follow the instructions below 


1. Create / Update 00_config.ini file
	Note : Before executing this , please check if this file is already created and updated with latest info
	a.	MANUALLY CREATE : The file need to be created or updated in the folder
			C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\instance\cnf
	b. (ALTERNATIVELY ) RUNTHE BATCH FILE :001_00config_ini_file_update.bat in  cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\instance
		which will run 001_00config_ini_file_update.py file to update 00_config.ini file from config.ini file.	
		
		RESULT : The file 00_config.ini contains the details as below in case of Company_0	
			[MySQL]
			Company=Company_0
			gcname=GCompany_0
			name=Company_0
			instances=3
			base_port=3306

			port0=3311
			port1=3312
			port2=3313
			port3=33130

		Note that port0 represents the port for instance0, port1 for instance1, and so on. These ports are associated 
		with the corresponding my.ini files also it would create instancesFolder section with list of instances.

2. Create / Update global_variables.ini file 
	Note : Before executing this , please check if this file is already created and updated with latest info
	a.	MANUALLY CREATE : The file need to be created or updated in the folder
			C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\instance\cnf
	b. (ALTERNATIVELY ) RUNTHE BATCH FILE :002_global_ini_file_update_bat.bat in  cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\instance
		which will run 002_global_ini_file_update.py file to update global_variables.ini file from config.ini file.	
		
		RESULT : The file global_variables.ini contains the details as below  	
			[Global]
			COMPANY=Company_0
			SOURCE_FILE=C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\my.ini
			MYSQL_BIN=C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
			BASE_PATH=C:\SAS Opera\Companies
			
			Make sure to update the BASE_PATH and other values according to your environment.

3.	Create the instance directories (for the number of instances you need):
		a. MANUALLY create instance directories 
			OR
		b. (ALTERNATIVELY ) RUNTHE BATCH FILE :003_create_instance_folders.bat in  cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\instance

			C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance0
			C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance1
			C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance2
			C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance3
			Additionally, it will create the following subdirectories within each instance:
			data,logs,uploads	
			
4. Copy & update my.ini file to the instances
		a.  MANUALLY  copy the my.ini file from the MySQL installation directory:
				From : C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0

		b.	(ALTERNATIVELY ) RUNTHE BATCH FILE :004_copy_update_instance_myini_file_bat  from the folder C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\instance
			which will inturn call the python file 004_copy_update_instance_myini_file to copy and update file 
		
		RESULT : If you execute a OR b steps the end results would be 
			There wilbe my.ini file in the folder C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance1
		
		Note : you have the instructions how to update manually the my.ini file in the file 06_Instructions_to_Change_myini_file_Manually in the directory path

				find text similar to this and find the root password A temporary password is generated for root@localhost: :bfXda>*=9jk
			OR
		b. (ALTERNATIVELY ) RUNTHE BATCH FILE :006_get_mysql_root_pwd.bat in  cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\instance , which will run	
			python file 006_get_mysql_root_pwd.py . Once after successfully executed it will create a file root_password.txt in the folder C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance0 
		
		RESULT : The root password can be found in the err file or in the root_password.txt file
