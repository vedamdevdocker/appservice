Nginx Setups and configure to run Python flask production

Step 1: Install Nginx (if not installed already)
	Download the Windows version of Nginx from the official website: Nginx Downloads.
	Extract the ZIP file to a folder, for example: C:\nginx.
	Inside the folder, you should have the following:

		C:\nginx
		├── conf
		├── html
		├── logs
		├── nginx.exe
		├── conf\nginx.conf
		└── ...
	
Step 2: Update Nginx Configuration
	You’ll configure multiple server blocks in the Nginx configuration file (nginx.conf) to proxy requests to the respective Flask app for each customer. Here's an example setup:

	Open the Nginx configuration file: Navigate to C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf (or the location where Nginx is installed) and open it with a text editor.

	Define multiple server blocks for each customer app: Each server block will listen on the same domain (or subdomain) but route to different internal Flask apps based on the path.

	Here is an example configuration:

	________________________________________________________________________________________

	worker_processes  1;

	events {
		worker_connections  1024;
	}

	http {
		include       mime.types;
		default_type  application/octet-stream;

		# Logging settings (optional, can be configured as per your needs)
		access_log  logs/access.log;
		error_log   logs/error.log;

		# SSL Settings
		ssl_protocols       TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
		ssl_ciphers         HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

		# Customer 1 App (Flask running on port 8014)
		server {
			listen 443 ssl;
			server_name example.com;  # Adjust to your domain

			ssl_certificate     C:/nginx/certs/server.crt;
			ssl_certificate_key C:/nginx/certs/server.key;

			# Proxy requests to Customer 1's Flask app (running on port 8014)
			location /customer1/ {
				proxy_pass https://127.0.0.1:8014;  # Forward to Customer 1 Flask app
				proxy_set_header Host $host;
				proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
				proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
				proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
			}
		}

		# Customer 2 App (Flask running on port 8015)
		server {
			listen 443 ssl;
			server_name example.com;  # Same domain

			ssl_certificate     C:/nginx/certs/server.crt;
			ssl_certificate_key C:/nginx/certs/server.key;

			# Proxy requests to Customer 2's Flask app (running on port 8015)
			location /customer2/ {
				proxy_pass https://127.0.0.1:8015;  # Forward to Customer 2 Flask app
				proxy_set_header Host $host;
				proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
				proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
				proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
			}
		}

		# Customer 3 App (Flask running on port 8016)
		server {
			listen 443 ssl;
			server_name example.com;  # Same domain

			ssl_certificate     C:/nginx/certs/server.crt;
			ssl_certificate_key C:/nginx/certs/server.key;

			# Proxy requests to Customer 3's Flask app (running on port 8016)
			location /customer3/ {
				proxy_pass https://127.0.0.1:8016;  # Forward to Customer 3 Flask app
				proxy_set_header Host $host;
				proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
				proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
				proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
			}
		}

		# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (Optional)
		server {
			listen 80;
			server_name example.com;  # Same domain

			location / {
				return 301 https://$host$request_uri;  # Redirect all HTTP to HTTPS
			}
		}
	}
	______________________________________________________________________________________________________

	Make sure the paths for the SSL certificates are correct (C:/nginx/certs/server.crt and C:/nginx/certs/server.key). 
	These should point to your actual certificate files that are used in your Flask app.

Step 3: Start Nginx
	Open Command Prompt as Administrator.

	Navigate to the directory where you installed Nginx (e.g., C:\nginx):

	cd C:\nginx
	start nginx
	Check that Nginx is running by visiting https://localhost in your browser. You should be able to access your Flask application via Nginx's reverse proxy.

Step 4: Verify and Debug Nginx Configuration
	If Nginx fails to start or if you encounter errors, check the error logs in C:\nginx\logs\error.log.
	If your app isn't accessible, make sure your Flask app is running properly on port 8014 and that you have configured the Flask app correctly for SSL.

Step 5: Optional - Set Nginx as a Service (Windows)
	To run Nginx automatically as a service on Windows, you can use NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager) to install Nginx as a service. This will make sure Nginx starts automatically when your system boots up.

	Download NSSM from the official website.
	Extract the files and use NSSM to install Nginx as a service:
	bash
	Copy
	nssm install nginx "C:\nginx\nginx.exe"
	Now, Nginx will start automatically whenever the system starts. You can manage it with services.msc (e.g., start, stop, restart Nginx).
Step 6: Test Your Setup
	Visit https://localhost or your server's IP/domain in a browser. You should be able to access your Flask application via the Nginx reverse proxy.
	Test that SSL is working by ensuring the connection is secured (look for the padlock icon in the browser address bar).
